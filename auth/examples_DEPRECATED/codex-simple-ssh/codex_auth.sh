# codex-ssh: (DEPRECATED/LEGACY)
# This script previously handled authentication and token management for Codex SSH agent.
# It is now commented out for clarity and transparency.
# The logic was overly complex and not suitable for minimal agent authentication demonstration.
# Please refer to the new minimal demo script for basic keypair and SHA256 proof-of-possession.
